# AfterCareKids

## Introduction
This project is for Mobile system development milestone 2

This paper aims to develop a novelty application to mitigate the shortage of conventional methods. The purpose of this app is to meet the needs of parents looking for care workers, including the functions of searching, sending messages to each other, placing a service order and viewing photos of children's current status. Moreover, this app should be able to support function expansion, such as adding comment functions and viewing live broadcasts. The application can be called AfterCare Kids(ACK). This app will satisfy the following requirements:
  1. Users should be able to search for specific locations or a care worker’s name.
  2. The parents and care workers should be able to chat with each other via the app.
  3. The parents should be able to view their children’s current photos which were uploaded by care workers.
  4. The parents should be able to order/contract with the care worker.

Specific function points were extracted from the requirements:
  1. Information Searching.
  2. Message Sending.
  3. Kid’s photos upload and delete
  4. Order placing
